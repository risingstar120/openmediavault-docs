Workbench
#########

Here you can make settings that affect the |webui| of |omv|.

For example, you can change the port at which the |webui| can be reached.
You can also activate or force HTTPS.

By default, the user is automatically logged out of the |webui| after a
certain period of inactivity. You can adjust this time or deactivate the
functionality here.

.. note::
    If you make changes here and activate them, error messages may appear
    in the |webui| because the web server is restarted in the background.
    These error messages can be ignored.
