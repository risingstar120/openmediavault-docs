Installation via images
#######################

Prepare the image
-----------------
	`Etcher <https://etcher.io/>`_ can also be used to transfer ARM images
	into SD cards.

Boot the installer
------------------
	ARM images are ready to go, so boot from SD card and wait for the initial
	setup to complete. This takes around 30 minutes on slow devices like
	Raspberry PI.

	.. warning::

		Do not shut down the system during the initial setup. Give the system
		enough time to finish the setup stage, otherwise the system will be in
		a broken state.
