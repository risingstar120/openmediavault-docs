.. note::
   The whole disc will be occupied by the system and swap space [1]_, so size
   doesn't matter so much. Data storage on the system disc is not supported.

Spinning Harddisk, SSD [2]_, Disk-on-Module [3]_, CompactFlash [4]_ or USB thumb
drive [5]_ type drives can be used as system drive.

If you use a Flash Drive, select one with static wear leveling [6]_, without it
the drive will have a very short lifetime. It is also recommended to activate
the Flash Memory plugin: (see Plug-ins) The entire disk is used as system disk.
This disk can not be used to store user data.
