Support
=============

At present there are two ways of getting support, both of them are done by the community. The current support channels are:

|omv| `forums <http://forums.openmediavault.org/>`_.

There is also the official IRC channel more info :doc:`here <various/irc>`

Since last year there is also a discord group. You can get access by clicking `here <https://discord.gg/ZjknBdg>`_. 

Make sure you provide as much information as you can when posting in the forum and describing your problem. If you have an error in the webUI make sure you take screenshots of the backtrace, to identify properly what's failing.
